# Free Genesis Themes
A collection of free WordPress child themes for the Genesis Framework from StudioPress.
Unfortunately, I don't have time to keep these themes in active development.

If you have suggested changes, or anything else that you might find helpful, [please submit a pull request](https://github.com/cjkoepke/free-genesis-themes/compare) - chances are, these themes are out of date, and I'd love the help in keeping them useful to the community!

Have a question? [Submit an issue](https://github.com/cjkoepke/free-genesis-themes/issues/new).

## Disclaimer
Themes in this repository may not be up to date and/or compatible with current versions of WordPress or the Genesis Framework. I do not actively build Genesis themes for free anymore, so I can't guarantee that these are in good shape.

If you want to learn more, [read this post](https://calvinkoepke.com/free-genesis-themes/).

## Requirements
All themes require the Genesis Framework which can be purchased at [StudioPress](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis).
