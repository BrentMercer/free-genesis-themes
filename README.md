# Free Genesis Themes
A collection of free WordPress child themes for the Genesis Framework from StudioPress.
Unfortunately, I don't have time to keep these themes in active development, but if you have suggested changes, or anything else that you might find helpful, [please submit a pull request](https://github.com/cjkoepke/free-genesis-themes/compare) - chances are, these themes are out of date, and I'd love the help in keeping them useful to the community!

Have a question? [Submit an issue](https://github.com/cjkoepke/free-genesis-themes/issues/new).

## Requirements
All themes require the Genesis Framework which can be purchased at [StudioPress](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis).
