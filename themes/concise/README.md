Easily install using the theme ZIP file or via FTP.

## Theme Support
You can [submit an issue](https://github.com/cjkoepke/free-genesis-themes/issues/new) if you have a problem setting up the theme.

## Genesis Settings
Default settings for the Concise theme come automatically registered via the theme. There is no need to edit or modify your current Genesis theme settings.

## Widgets
1. The Home Top widget area uses a Text Widget with the following markup (no widget title):

```<h2>Title Goes Here</h2><h3>Subtitle goes here.</h3> Add some paragraph text. The button is an anchor tag that has the .button.button-cta classes attached to it.```

2. The Home Feature One-Three widgets use a Text Widget with the following markup (uses the widget title):

```<span class="dashicons dashicon-class-goes-here"></span> Add some paragraph text. The button is an anchor tag that has the .button.button-block classes attached to it.```

3. The Home Feature Full widget uses the Genesis - Featured Posts widget. Enter a title in the widget title box for your posts section (i.e. Recent Posts). Set number of posts to show to 6 or in multiples of 3. Make sure Post Title and Post Info are checked. Select Show Excerpt for the content type.

4. The Footer widget area utilizes the Simple Social Icons widget (a plugin made by StudioPress).

Enjoy!
